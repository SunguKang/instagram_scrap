This is from april 19 th. : A year-long Earthsight investigation found that fiber certified by ethical supply chain organization Better Cotton was grown on \u201cstolen\u201d and \u201cdeforested\u201d land in Brazil. A year-long investigation by nonprofit Earthsight published last week found that cotton grown on what the group said is \u201cstolen\u201d and \u201cdeforested\u201d land in Brazil\u2019s Cerrado region appeared in garments approved by supply chain certifier Better Cotton and sold by retail giants H&M and Zara parent company Inditex.\nThe traced cotton is grown in the Brazilian state of Bahia by two of the country\u2019s largest producers, SLC Agr\u00edcola and Grupo Horita, per the report, which said both companies have been fined repeatedly for environmental violations. The investigation traced the cotton to eight Asia-based clothing manufacturers that supply H&M and Inditex with \u201cmillions\u201d of garments, per the investigation.
